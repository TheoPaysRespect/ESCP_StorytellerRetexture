    <description>It is about time that everyone accepts what we knew all along, that Randy is Sheogorath.\n\nThis mod was meant to replace just Randy with Sheogorath as an April Fool's joke, but will eventually be updated with replacers for Cassandra and Pheobe as well as a proper preview image. This replacement is visual only and does not affect gameplay in any way.</description>
