            <description>Uncle Sheo doesn't follow rules. He'll generate random events, and he doesn't care if they make a story of triumph or utter hopelessness. The wilder the story, the happier he is.\n\nWarning: When you expect peace, he will give you conflict, and when you expect conflict, he will give you peace. Only then shall you understand true madness.</description>
